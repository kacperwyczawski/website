                            Arx is a chess-based strategy game with fairy pieces
                            and resource management. Thanks to this project, I
                            have learned TypeScript and development of more
                            complex web applications.

                        <Project name="autocut">
                            Panel cutting optimization software that runs
                            seamlessly on any modern browser or device using PWA
                            technology. This app utilizes algorithms written in
                            TypeScript to optimize stock cutting, saving time
                            and reducing waste. This project won a special prize
                            at the "Circular Business Transformation" hackathon.
